The Magical Unicorn font is a display typeface for large sizes and consists of two different typefaces, the Princess (a normal Unicorn) and the Sans (without horn) Each letter has two different versions usable by typing in lower case or capitals. For less powerful computers or use with long pieces of text, there is also a 'light' version included.

Punctuation, numerals and many other glyphs are included. Since the font is for headers mostly, I didn't include glyphs such as the Dollar Sign, percent or various brackets.



Please do give the Unicorns a good place to graze in your creations.

Disclaimer: Summoning the Magical Unicorns from the Mystical Realm to your computer requires arcane incantations and energy. Your computer may slow down while loading, typing or printing this font.
